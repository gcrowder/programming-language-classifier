/*
 * This Java3D program:
 *    Creates an instance of the JavaSoundMixer AudioDevice, initializing it
 *         and attaching it to the PhysicalEnvironment by using
 *         SimpleUniverse.
 *    Creates one uncached Background and two cached Point sound sources.
 *    Creates and executes a custom behavior (SimpleSoundsBehavior) that
 *         starts the sound playing and transforms the PointSound source
 *         by modifying the TransformGroup that contains the Sound nodes.
 *
 * Usage: 
 *    java SimpleSounds [URLpath [name1 [name2 [name2]]]]
 *
 * The first optional command line parameter is the URL path to directory
 *       containing "file:" or "http:" and then directory path string.
 *    If you are using the suppled default sound files in the same directory
 *       as this test program then only the URLpath need be supplied on the 
 *       command line.
 *    If this parameter is not included then the current path to the directory
 *       this program is running in is used for an application
 *       and the codebase is used for an applet.
 * The second thru fourth optional command line parameters are sound file names
 *    If not given, the default file names are:
 *       techno_machine.au
 *       hello_universe.au
 *       roar.au
 *    that correspond to the 3 'voice' quality, 8-bit, u-law, 8-kHz samples
 *    included in the same directory as this test program.
 * 
 *    Java Sound engine has been advertised to support the following 8- and 16-
 *    bit, linear and u-law, mono and stereo sound sample file formats: AU,
 *    AIFF, WAV, and PCM.  Non-cached MIDI and RMF files are also supported.
 *    Neither compressed formats (DVI, GSM, MOD) nor A-law formated files are
 *    supported at this time.
